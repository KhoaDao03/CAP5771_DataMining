Explanation of logistic_regression.py
Loading Data:

Reads the pre-split classification datasets from the outputs/ folder.
Training the Model:

Initializes and trains a LogisticRegression model using the training data.
max_iter=1000 ensures convergence.
Evaluating the Model:

Predicts on the test set and calculates evaluation metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Generates and saves:
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of actual vs. predicted classes.
ROC Curve: Illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classifier.
Saving the Model:

Saves the trained model using joblib for future use.
c. Run Logistic Regression
Navigate to src/ Directory:

Right-click on logistic_regression.py and select Run 'logistic_regression'.
Check Outputs:

Console: Review evaluation metrics and classification report.
