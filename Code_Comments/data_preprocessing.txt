Explanation of data_preprocessing.py
Loading Data:

The load_data function reads the Math (student-mat.csv) and Portuguese (student-por.csv) datasets.
Merging Datasets:

The merge_datasets function merges both datasets based on common attributes, handling duplicate students by averaging their grades.
Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Values: Replaces '?' with NaN and drops any rows with missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Uses LabelEncoder to convert categorical variables into numerical formats.
Feature Scaling: Applies StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.
Splitting Data:

Splits the data into training and testing sets for both regression (G3) and classification (pass/fail).
Creating Classification Target:

Defines a binary target pass, where 1 indicates a final grade (G3) of 10 or above, and 0 otherwise.
Saving Preprocessed Data:

Saves the preprocessed data and splits into the outputs/ folder for use in modeling scripts.
c. Run Data Preprocessing
Before proceeding, execute the data preprocessing script to prepare your data.

Navigate to src/ Directory:

In PyCharm, right-click on data_preprocessing.py and select Run 'data_preprocessing'.
Verify Outputs:

Check the outputs/ folder for the following files:
preprocessed_data.csv
X_train_reg.csv, X_test_reg.csv, y_train_reg.csv, y_test_reg.csv
X_train_clf.csv, X_test_clf.csv, y_train_clf.csv, y_test_clf.csv
